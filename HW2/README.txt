Note 1: I have created employee_meeting_bridge to handle many to many relationship between employee and meeting table
Note 2: I have used name "patient" instead of "case" (mentioned in homework ER digram given for reference) for the table
Note 3: In Q3 I have put 2 queries 
        Query 1 : In this query for finding the sickest floor I have only considered employees whose current status is "sick"
        Query 2 : In this query for finding the sickest floor I have considered that employees whose current status is "hospitalized" are also sick
Note 4: In Q4 I have considered the date range of "2023-08-01" AND "2023-08-20" and have made a single query for all the required counts
Note 5: In Q5 I have created a query for getting the names and ID's of employees who have self-reported for all the 5 symptoms and I have used the Division for that
Note 6: I am also submitting .txt files of all the queries in case .sql file doesn't open up
